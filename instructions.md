# Project Requirements

## 1. Update Page Count
- Create three HTML pages:
  - `index.html`
  - Two additional pages with content-specific names (e.g., `about.html`, `contact.html`).
- Ensure proper navigation links exist for all possible paths between the pages.

## 2. Organize Files
- Move all image files to an `img` folder.
- Move CSS files to a `styles` folder.
- Update file paths in your HTML files to reflect these changes.

## 3. Write Notes
- Create a `notes.txt` file in the root folder.
- Write one paragraph each about your experience learning:
  1. HTML
  2. CSS
  3. Git

## 4. Set Up Git and GitHub
- Initialize a Git repository in your project folder.
- Make at least **3 commits** during development.
- Add a `.gitignore` file to exclude `notes.txt`.
- Push your project to a **public GitHub repository**.
- Host your site using **GitHub Pages**.
